Adds a custom shipping method to WooCommerce for delivery services.

== Description ==

Delivery Fees for WooCommerce adds a custom shipping method to WooCommerce specifically for delivery services.

When you add the **DFWC Delivery Fees** shipping method to your shipping zone, it automatically turns your WooCommerce store's **Shipping** text into **Delivery**.

## Built for delivery services

WooCommerce lets you add *Shipping Zones* but what about companies who only offer delivery?

That's where the Delivery Fees for WooCommerce plugin comes in!

We know that not all businesses ship products, instead delivering them directly to customers.

So to go along with our [Delivery Drivers](https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/delivery-drivers-for-woocommerce) plugin, we created the Delivery Fees for WooCommerce plugin which adds a custom WooCommerce Shipping Method to cater to delivery services like yours.

## Features

* Unlimited shipping methods and cost rules
* Offer free delivery with minimum order
* Automatically change "Shipping" to "Delivery" in order details.
* ... and more!

## Pro Features

* Adds Fee types for flat fee or percentage

* Adds Fee type for time (per minute)
* Require a minimum order amount before checkout
